# VinylStore
REPORT

Myrzabekov Farkhat: I have worked on database creation and implemented the struct Record to store all main info 
about vinyl recordings like ID, Title, Artist,Genre,Price,ImagePath and worked on rendering(passing) the data to templates.
I have decided to suggest my teammate to use SQLite to store our data, because it is lightweight and easy to develop. 
Also I have helped on debugging the code and installing all the software needed to complete the task.

Nashkenova Ingkar: I have designed project structure especially how to represent vinyls list. I have come up with
idea of adding sorting system and implemented it in code based on different fields such as price, author and etc.
Also I have added functionality to search vinyls by keywords, so if you type Ed Sheeran it will display all the 
vinyls containing Ed Sheeran keyword in title or author.
